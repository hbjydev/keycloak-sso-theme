# keycloak-sso-theme

A Keycloak theme I'm building for an SSO system inspired (design-wise) by
Discord's authentication service.

## Developing

To get started, just run `docker-compose up -d` -- everything needed to get
going is included in the repository. Once booted, the container for Keycloak
will be available on `http://localhost:8080`.

You can test your local copy of the theme by going to https://keycloak.org/app
(the defaults are fine) and selecting "Save Options" and then "Log In".

## License

This theme (and all its files) are licensed under the BSD 3-Clause license,
a copy of which can be found in the accompanying [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file,
